# Spacewar Game

A 2D space shooter game built in C# that lets players control a spaceship and battle against enemy ships. This project was created as part of a learning experience for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

# Description

The player controls a spaceship that can move and shoot.

Multiple types of enemy spaceships appear, each with unique behaviors.

The goal is to destroy enemies while avoiding being hit.

The game keeps track of score and time, showing high scores at the end.

This project demonstrates OOP principles, such as inheritance (different enemy types), encapsulation, and polymorphism.
